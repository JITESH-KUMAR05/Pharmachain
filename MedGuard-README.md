# üè• MedGuard - Privacy-Preserving Healthcare Verification

**Winner Solution for Midnight Hackathon 2025**

> Zero-knowledge healthcare verification that proves eligibility, credentials, and access rights without exposing underlying medical data.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Current healthcare verification systems expose sensitive patient data during routine processes:
- **Insurance verification** reveals full medical history
- **Medical credential checks** expose personal information  
- **Provider access** requires sharing unnecessary PHI
- **Cross-facility referrals** leak comprehensive patient data

**Cost**: $10+ billion annually in data breach costs across healthcare systems.

## üí° MedGuard Solution

Zero-knowledge healthcare verification using **Midnight Network** that proves eligibility, credentials, and access rights without exposing underlying medical data.

### üîí Core Privacy Features

‚úÖ **Insurance Verification** - Prove coverage without revealing policy details  
‚úÖ **Medical Credential Verification** - Verify doctor licenses without personal data exposure  
‚úÖ **Patient Consent Management** - Dynamic consent with ZK proofs of authorization  
‚úÖ **HIPAA Compliant by Design** - No sensitive data on-chain, complete privacy protection  

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture (`medguard.compact`)
```compact
pragma language_version 0.15;
import CompactStandardLibrary;

// Healthcare verification ledgers for privacy-preserving verification
export ledger insurance_registry: Map<Bytes, Boolean>;
export ledger credential_registry: Map<Bytes, Boolean>;
export ledger patient_consent: Map<Bytes, Boolean>;

// Zero-knowledge verification circuits
export circuit verify_insurance_coverage(policy_hash: Bytes): Boolean
export circuit verify_medical_credentials(credential_hash: Bytes): Boolean  
export circuit verify_patient_consent(consent_hash: Bytes): Boolean
export circuit verify_healthcare_access(policy_hash: Bytes, credential_hash: Bytes, consent_hash: Bytes): Boolean
```
